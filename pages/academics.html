                <h2>Nalanda was an ancient center of learning in India, attracting scholars from across Asia.</h2>
                <p>We encourage our students to explore the academic landscape, venturing into unfamiliar fields of
                    knowledge and, perhaps, discovering new passions that will take them in a different direction
                    altogether. Along the way, faculty members help guide them, and fellow students offer diverse
                    perspectives that can shed new light on the path. We also encourage our students to travel
                    literally, by going abroad for study, research, or work.</p>
